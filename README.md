# GoogleMapsJS

An exercise project for my independent study course. Uses JS, JQuery, and GCP Maps/Geocoding API. 

I created a parser to scrap data off of http://city-data.com to allow the user to click on vicinities on the map and get instantenous information about each such as population, gender distribution, and median age.
